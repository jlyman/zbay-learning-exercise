- Make sidebar and main class components

3. Create the Listing model in JS
4. Change the Main comp to accept a listing prop, and show a 0 state
5. Create a temporary listing model, and pass that in. Replace static text with listing details
6. Pull in the fetch code from the vanilla JS version, and talk about lifecycle components and state
